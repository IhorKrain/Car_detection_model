# Car Detection and Model Comparison Project

## Project Description

This project includes:
- Car detection using a machine learning model.
- Model comparison based on various parameters (accuracy, speed, etc.).
- A Telegram bot that allows users to upload images and analyze them.

## Installation and Setup

### Installing Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed and install the required libraries:
